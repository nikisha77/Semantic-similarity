    "Model: mrp/SimCSE-model-WangchanBERTa-V2\n",
    "This model is part of the SimCSE framework, which applies supervised contrastive learning to train BERT-based models. It uses contrastive learning on NLI data (or other labeled datasets) to fine-tune the model, making it highly specialized for sentence similarity tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Strategy: The strategy of contrastive learning in SimCSE aims to pull together similar sentence pairs and push apart dissimilar ones, which directly improves the ability of the model to compute sentence similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "Correct â€” SimCSE outperforms many other methods in semantic similarity tasks because it specifically optimizes for sentence-level representation using supervised contrastive learning. It is considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) for sentence similarity tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: This model excels in tasks requiring high precision, such as semantic search, QA reranking, and paraphrase detection."
