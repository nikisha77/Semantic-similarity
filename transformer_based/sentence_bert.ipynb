    "Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2\n",
    "all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is indeed a commonly used model in Sentence-BERT, designed to be smaller and faster while still providing high-quality sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Strategy: Sentence-BERT uses siamese and triplet networks, which are explicitly trained for sentence similarity tasks, with training on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and paraphrase datasets. This allows SBERT to capture semantic meaning more effectively than BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "The information here is correct: SBERT is optimized for semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and is faster than the original BERT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: SBERT is indeed commonly used for real-time applications like semantic search, deduplication, and similarity matching"
